      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Priya, a passionate about gaining more and more knowledge. My origin is basically from India but right now, I am living in Surrey, a beautiful city of British Columbia. I am having a strong foundation in retail sales and management. I always encourage myself to be a better human and fulfilling my dreams by my own.
From a young age, I've been captivated by health care and sciences, which led me to explore the world of medicine. However, I was unable to complete my studies because of tution fees. So, I explore my inner self more deeply. I got to know my other intersts and I started woring on them and I find immense joy in Retail manegement.
